# SwiftUI-ViewModifier-FocusedState

This project builds upon: [SwiftUI-Learning-Binding-Basics](https://github.com/mikechan1234/SwiftUI-Learning-Binding-Basics)

- Developed in Xcode 13.2.1
- The projects applies the `@FocusState` keyword to demonstrate the usage of how to dismiss the keyboard 
- The project also uses `ViewModifier`/`TextFieldStyle` in how to modify views. Whilst we can create custom extensions and add a function to a `View`, one of the biggest advantages of using a `ViewModifier` is that it can store properties.
